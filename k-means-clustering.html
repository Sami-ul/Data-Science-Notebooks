            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                K-Means Clustering is a popular machine learning algorithm that
                is used for clustering problems.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is an unsupervised learning method that attempts to group
                similar data points into clusters.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>How it Works</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                K-Means works by first selecting K random points in the dataset,
                known as centroids.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each data point is then assigned to the nearest centroid based
                on a distance metric such as Euclidean distance.
              </li>
              <li>
                The centroid is then updated by taking the mean of all the data
                points assigned to it.
              </li>
              <li>
                This process is repeated until the centroids no longer move or a
                maximum number of iterations is reached.
              </li>
              <li>
                The resulting clusters are the groups of data points that are
                closest to each centroid.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                K-Means can be applied to a variety of fields, including image
                segmentation, market segmentation, and anomaly detection.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is commonly used in image segmentation to group similar
                pixels together, which can be useful for object recognition and
                background removal.
              </li>
              <li>
                In market segmentation, K-Means can be used to group customers
                based on their purchasing habits.
              </li>
              <li>
                It can also be used for anomaly detection to identify unusual
                behavior in network traffic or financial transactions.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                K-Means has several strengths that make it a useful algorithm:
              </li>
              <li>
                It is simple to implement and computationally efficient, making
                it a good choice for large datasets.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is a fast algorithm that can quickly group data points into
                clusters.
              </li>
              <li>
                It does not require any training data or prior knowledge of the
                data distribution.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Weaknesses</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>K-Means also has some weaknesses:</li>
              <li>
                It is sensitive to the choice of K, which can have a significant
                impact on the quality of the resulting clusters.
              </li>
              <li>
                The algorithm is not well-suited for datasets with unevenly
                sized clusters or non-globular shapes.
              </li>
              <li>
                It can be sensitive to the scale of the data, so it is often
                necessary to normalize the features before applying the
                algorithm.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Restrictions</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                K-Means also has some restrictions that should be taken into
                account when using the algorithm:
              </li>
              <li>
                It assumes that the clusters are spherical and have the same
                variance, which may not always be the case.
              </li>
              <li>
                It assumes that the clusters have roughly the same number of
                data points, which may not be true in some cases.
              </li>
              <li>
                The algorithm can get stuck in local optima, so it is often
                necessary to run the algorithm multiple times with different
                initial centroids.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                K-Means is a popular unsupervised learning algorithm that can be
                used for clustering problems.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is a fast and efficient algorithm that can be used to group
                similar data points into clusters.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is a simple algorithm that does not require any training data
                or prior knowledge of the data distribution.
              </li>
              <li>
                However, it is sensitive to the choice of K and can get stuck in
                local optima, so it is often necessary to run the algorithm
                multiple times with different initial centroids.
              </li>
